## Problem Title: Persistent `NotImplementedError` in PyTorch Quantization Evaluation on Host Machine

### Description:
The `evaluate_quantization.py` script, intended to compare FP32 and INT8 model performance, consistently fails with a `NotImplementedError` when attempting to run the quantized (INT8) model. The error message indicates that the `quantized::conv2d.new` operation, a fundamental part of quantized convolutional layers, cannot be run with the specified backend (initially CUDA, then CPU).

### Root Cause Analysis:

1.  **Initial Error (`CUDA` backend):**
    *   When the script was first run, the `int8_model` was being moved to the `device` variable, which was set to `cuda` because a CUDA-enabled GPU was detected on your host machine.
    *   The `NotImplementedError` with the `CUDA` backend suggests that the PyTorch build you are using on your host machine, while supporting CUDA for FP32 operations, does *not* have the necessary CUDA kernels compiled or enabled for *quantized* operations. This is a common scenario, as quantized operations often require specific build configurations or are only supported on certain hardware/software combinations.

2.  **Attempted Fix (Force `CPU` backend):**
    *   To circumvent the CUDA quantization issue, we attempted to force the `int8_model` and its `input_tensor` to run on the CPU by explicitly calling `.to('cpu')`.
    *   However, this led to a new `NotImplementedError`, this time complaining about the `CPU` backend, even though `QuantizedCPU` (and `fbgemm`) are listed as supported.

3.  **Why `CPU` Backend Failed (The Core Misunderstanding):**
    *   The crucial piece of information you provided was that you are developing on a **host machine (likely x86 architecture) to simulate the NX Edge device**.
    *   The `qconfig` we were using (`'qnnpack'`) is an optimized backend for **ARM CPUs**, which are found in devices like the Jetson Xavier NX. It is *not* the standard or optimized backend for **x86 CPUs** (your host machine).
    *   When `torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('qnnpack')` is called on an x86 machine, it might still return a `qconfig` object, but the underlying `quantized::conv2d.new` operator for `qnnpack` is not implemented for x86 CPUs, leading to the `NotImplementedError`.

4.  **State Dictionary Loading Issues (Secondary Problem):**
    *   During one of the attempts, we also encountered `RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict... Missing key(s)... Unexpected key(s)... Copying from quantized Tensor to non-quantized Tensor is not allowed`.
    *   This happened because we tried to load a `state_dict` of an *already quantized* model (`quantized_int8_model.pth`) into a model that was only *prepared* for quantization (meaning it still had floating-point weights and observer modules). PyTorch's quantization workflow requires that a quantized `state_dict` be loaded into a model that has *already been converted* to its quantized form. The `quantized_int8_model.pth` likely contains quantized tensors (e.g., `qint8`), which cannot be directly loaded into a floating-point model.

### Conclusion:
The primary problem is the mismatch between the chosen CPU quantization backend (`qnnpack`) and the host machine's architecture (x86). The `quantized_int8_model.pth` was likely created with `qnnpack` in mind, or at least with a quantization process that is not directly compatible with the default x86 CPU quantization backend (`fbgemm`) without proper calibration.

### Proposed Solution:
1.  **Use the correct CPU backend for the host machine:** For x86 CPUs, the recommended backend for PyTorch quantization is `fbgemm`.
2.  **Properly load the quantized model:** The `load_int8_model` function needs to:
    *   Instantiate the FP32 model architecture.
    *   Set its `qconfig` to `fbgemm`.
    *   Call `torch.quantization.prepare(model)` to insert observer modules.
    *   **Perform a dummy forward pass (calibration) on the `model_prepared` to collect statistics.** This is crucial for `fbgemm` to properly quantize the model.
    *   Call `torch.quantization.convert(model_prepared)` to convert the model to its quantized version.
    *   Finally, load the `state_dict` from `quantized_int8_model.pth` into this *converted* INT8 model.
